    Quote(phrase: "But I’ll tell you one thing: I once had a high that not even crack cocaine could match. That was when I got my first driver’s license! Look out, world, here comes Kurt Vonnegut.", work: "Cold Turkey"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "And I really do think that what we perceive as time is simply a processing device in our heads to let us consider a little of reality at a time — we couldn’t let it all come in at once.", work: "WNYC interview"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Many people need desperately to receive this message: 'I feel and think much as you do, care about many of the things you care about, although most people do not care about them. You are not alone.'", work: "Timequake"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "If you can do a half-assed job of anything, you're a one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind.", work: "Player Piano"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.", work: "Cat's Cradle"),

    Quote(phrase: "If you can do no good, at least do no harm.", work: "Slapstick"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "There should have been a secretary of the future.", work: "Armageddon in Retrospect"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "By working so hard at becoming wise and reasonable and well-informed, you have made our little planet, our precious little moist, blue-green ball, a saner place than it was before you got here.", work: "If This Isn't Nice, What is?"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "The highest treason in the USA is to say Americans are not loved, no matter where they are, no matter what they are doing there.", work: "A Man Without a Country"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "But you do have a peaceful planet here: Today we do. On other days we have wars as horrible as any you’ve ever seen or read about. There isn’t anything we can do about them, so we simply don’t look at them. We ignore them. We spend eternity looking at pleasant moments - like today at the zoo. Isn’t this a nice moment?", work: "Slaughterhouse-Five"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off statues and defecated into grand pianos. I now understand: it was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform — uncontrollable fear.", work: "Happy Birthday, Wanda June"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "I had hoped, as a broadcaster, to be merely ludicrous, but this is a hard world to be ludicrous in, with so many human beings so reluctant to laugh, so incapable of thought, so eager to believe and snarl and hate.", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.", work: "Slaughterhouse-Five"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "If we desolate this planet, Nature can get life going again. All it takes is a few million years or so, the wink of an eye to Nature.", work: "Fates Worse than Death"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "A sappy woman sent me a letter a few years back. She knew I was sappy, too... She was about to have a baby, not mine, and wished to know if it was a bad thing to bring such a sweet and innocent creature into a world as bad as this one is. I replied that what made being alive almost worthwhile for me... was all the saints I met... By saints I meant people who behaved decently in a strikingly indecent society. Perhaps some of you are or will become saints for her child to meet.", work: "Knowing What’s Nice"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "We don't piss in your ashtrays, So please don't throw cigarettes in our urinals.", work: "God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "It was going to be about the love my wife and I had for each other. It was going to show how a pair of lovers in a world gone mad could survive by being loyal only to a nation composed of themselves — a nation of two.", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I think I succeeded as a writer because I did not come out of an English department. I used to write in the Chemistry department. And I wrote some good stuff. If I had been in the English department, the prof would have looked at my short stories, congratulated me on my talent, and then showed me how Joyce or Hemingway handled the same elements of the short story. The prof would have placed me in competition with the greatest writers of all time, and that would have ended my writing career.", work: "Article in The A to Z Review"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Humanists try to behave decently and honorably without any expectation of rewards or punishments in an afterlife. The creator of the universe has been to us unknowable so far. We serve as well as we can the highest abstraction of which we have some understanding, which is our community.", work: "Timequake"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "And when that nation ceased to be, I became what I am today and what I always will be, a stateless person.", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "But actually, to practice any art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow. So do it. Dance on your way out of here. Sing on your way out of here. Write a love poem when you get home. Draw a picture of your bed or roommate.", work: "Knowing What’s Nice"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I think we've damaged the planet so severely we're going to be severely penalized. And it's too bad. There are so many rash acts. It just amazes me, for instance, to think of the methodical dumping of poison into the Great Lakes. What kind of mind would dream up, or approve, something like that?", work: "Two Conversations with Kurt..."),
    
    Quote(phrase: "I came to speak ill of Swedish engineering, and so diddled myself out of a Nobel Prize.", work: "Have I Got a Car For You!"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "We are monkeys.", work: "In-the-Bone Reading"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "My father is a lot of trouble to write about. He was, and chose to be, a dreamy artist and a good one. Because he found the real world ugly, he had no interest in it. Now this, to me, was not a form of insanity. Rather, it was a wonderful intellectual conclusion, based on careful and extensive observation.", work: "Two Conversations with Kurt..."),
    
    Quote(phrase: "I know about the Second Amendment, and I’m for it. It doesn’t say people who disagree with a president should shoot him, which is what John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald did. It says in effect that civilians interested in playing with man-killing devices and live ammunition can best serve the rest of us in the National Guard.", work: "If This Isn’t Nice, What Is?"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "I think one reason the critics have been slow, even up to this moment, in acknowledging me as a serious writer, is that I don't use semicolons...; I never understood them... ; They don't really stand for anything...; I think it's a way of just showing off you've been to college.", work: "On the value of semicolons"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Many of you have been to Timbuktu. Many of you have been to Katmandu.  My dentist just got home from Fiji. He told me all about Fiji.  If he had taken his fingers out of my mouth, I would have told him about the Galapagos Islands.", work: "Fates Worse than Death"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "What painters and sculptors and writers do, incidentally, is put very small properties indeed into good order, as best they can.", work: "Article in Rolling Stone"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "It’s about how the future has as much to do with the present as the past does. Giraffes can only have come from the future. There’s no way evolution in the past would have let something that defenseless and impractical live for 15 minutes.", work: "Requiem for a Dreamer"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I apologize because of the terrible mess the planet is in. But it has always been a mess. There have never been any ‘Good Old Days,’ there have just been days. And as I say to my grandchildren, ‘Don’t look at me. I just got here myself.'", work: "Syracuse University speech"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "If you can’t write clearly, you probably don’t think nearly as well as you think you do.", work: "Armageddon in Retrospect"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "And nobody can do a thing about it. It’s too late in the game. Don’t spoil the party, but here’s the truth: We have squandered our planet’s resources, including air and water, as though there were no tomorrow, so now there isn’t going to be one.", work: "The End is Near"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "I have a very primitive approach to science — I wonder how the universe originated, how could it have originated … how could you make something out of nothing … and sophomoric ideas like that.", work: "WNYC interview"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I get my envelope and seal it up and go to the postal convenience center down the block at the corner of Forty-seventh Street and Second Avenue, where I'm secretly in love with the woman behind the counter. I keep absolutely poker-faced; I never let her know how I feel about her. One time I had my pocket picked in there and got to meet a cop and tell him about it.", work: "Technology and Me"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "An author gets to a point where he needs a couple of coincidences to keep the story moving, and he doesn't dare pause for thirty pages to contrive an elaborate sequence of believable events in order to get a few characters together. So, he takes a deep breath and treats himself to a coincidence. Then he worries himself sick about whether he's lost his reader.", work: "Two Conversations with Kurt..."),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "My mother and father died. Some say they died of broken hearts. They died in their middle sixties, at any rate, when hearts break easily.", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I worry about the ignorance of the lawyers who rule us because they know nothing about biology and chemistry. They know nothing about the atmosphere or the ecological crises that threaten us. They are accustomed to arguing problems away, and most of the problems we're facing now are so stringently biological, so primitive really, that they can't be solved with rhetoric.", work: "Two Conversations with Kurt..."),
    
    Quote(phrase: "On about February 14th the Americans came over, followed by the RAF. Their combined labors killed 250,000 people in twenty-four hours and destroyed all of Dresden, possibly the world's most beautiful city. But not me.", work: "Interview in Newsweek"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Do you know what a Luddite is? That’s a person who doesn’t like newfangled contraptions. Contraptions like nuclear submarines armed with Poseidon missiles that have H-bombs in their warheads, and like computers that cheat you out of becoming. Bill Gates says, 'Wait till you can see what your computer can become.' But it’s you who should be doing the becoming. What you can become is the miracle you were born to work — not the damn fool computer.", work: "Knowing What’s Nice"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "First things first: I want it clearly understood that this mustache I’m wearing is my father’s mustache. I should have brought his photograph. My big brother Bernie, now dead, a physical chemist who discovered that silver iodide can sometimes make it snow or rain, he wore it, too.", work: "Strange Weather Lately"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "'You hate America, don't you?' she said. 'That would be as silly as loving it,' I said.", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "It’s only recently that I’ve come to understand that writers are not marginal to our society, that they, in fact, do all our thinking for us, that we are writing myths and our myths are believed, and that old myths are believed until someone writes a new one.", work: "WNYC interview"),
   
    
    Quote(phrase: "'All people are insane,' he said. 'They will do anything at any time, and God help anybody who looks for reasons.'", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Dr. Vonnegut said this to his doddering old dad: “Father, we are here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is.” So I pass that on to you. Write it down, and put it in your computer, so you can forget it.", work: "Cold Turkey"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "As a member of a zippier generation, with sparkle in its eyes and a snap in its stride, let me tell you what kept us as high as kites a lot of the time: hatred... It is a tragedy, perhaps, that human beings can get so much energy and enthusiasm from hate. If you want to feel ten feet tall and as though you could run a hundred miles without stopping, hate beats pure cocaine any day. Hitler resurrected a beaten, bankrupt, half-starved nation with hatred and nothing more. Imagine that.", work: "If This Isn't Nice, What is?"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Novelists have, on the average, about the same IQs as the cosmetic consultants at Bloomingdale’s department store. Our power is patience. We have discovered that writing allows even a stupid person to seem halfway intelligent, if only that person will write the same thought over and over again, improving it just a little bit each time. It is a lot like inflating a blimp with a bicycle pump. Anybody can do it. All it takes is time.", work: "Article in The A to Z Review"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "I wish one and all, long and happy lives, no matter what may become of them afterwards. Use sunscreen! Don’t smoke cigarettes. Cigars, however, are good for you … Firearms are also good for you … Gunpowder has zero fat and zero cholesterol. That goes for dumdums, too.", work: "God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I keep losing and regaining my equilibrium, which is the basic plot of all popular fiction. And I myself am a work of fiction.", work: "Wampeters, Foma & Granfalloons"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "We wrote books simply to exist, to be read.", work: "In-the-Bone Reading"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "This is the information revolution. We have taken it very badly so far. Information seems to be getting in the way all the time. Human beings have had to guess about almost everything for the past million years or so. Our most enthralling and sometimes terrifying guessers are the leading characters in our history books. I will name two of them: Aristotle and Hitler. One good guesser and one bad one.", work: "Your Guess Is as Good as Mine"),

    
    Quote(phrase: "Scientists for all their creativity, will never discover a method for making people deader than dead.", work: "Fates Worse than Death"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "We may never dissuade leaders of our nation or any other nation from responding vengefully, violently, to every insult or injury. In this, the Age of Television, they will continue to find irresistible the temptation to become entertainers, to compete with movies by blowing up bridges and police stations and factories and so on…", work: "If This Isn't Nice, What is?"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "A thousand years from now, if there are still human beings on Earth, everyone of those human beings will be descended from us—and from everyone who has chosen to reproduce.", work: "Fates Worse than Death"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I do push-ups and sit-ups all the time, and feel as though I am getting lean and sinewy, but maybe not. Last night, time and my body decided to take me to the movies. I saw 'The Umbrellas of Cherbourg', which I took very hard. To an unmoored, middle-aged man like myself, it was heart-breaking. That’s all right. I like to have my heart broken.", work: "Kurt Vonnegut: Letters"),
    
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "This is not the first time I have been accused of being a humanist. All of twenty-five years ago, when I was teaching at the University of Iowa, a student all of a sudden said to me, 'I hear you're a humanist.' I said, 'Oh, yeah? What's a humanist?' He said, 'That's what I'm asking you. Aren't you getting paid to answer questions like that?'", work: "Why My Dog Is Not a Humanist"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I find that, as a writer, I share a problem, perhaps you could call it a tragedy, with most human beings: a tendency to lose contact with my own intelligence.", work: "Two Conversations with Kurt..."),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Strange I never dream of Hitler or Goebbels or Hoess or Goering or any of the other nightmare people of the world war numbered 'two.' I dream of women, instead.", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Your government does not exist, and should not exist, in order to keep you or anybody else—no matter what color, no matter what race, no matter what religion—from getting your damn fool feelings hurt.", work: "If This Isn’t Nice, What Is?"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "The worst thing that could possibly happen to anybody would be to not be used for anything by anybody. Thank you for using me, even though I didn't want to be used by anybody.", work: "The Sirens of Titan"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Don’t you think that’s the main reason people find [writing] so difficult? If they can write complete sentences and can use a dictionary, isn’t that the only reason they find writing hard: they don’t know or care about anything?", work: "Article in The A to Z Review"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I am an old fool who borrowed the dreams of a young fool. I bought myself some canvas and paint, and I came to Greenwich Village.", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Everybody's shaking in his boots, so don't be bluffed.", work: "Player Piano"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "I work at home, and if I wanted to, I could have a computer right by my bed, and I'd never have to leave it. But I use a typewriter, and afterward I mark up the pages with a pencil. Then I call up this woman named Carol out in Woodstock and say, 'Are you still doing typing?' Sure she is, and her husband is trying to track bluebirds out there and not having much luck, and so we chitchat back and forth.", work: "Technology and Me"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "What is it the slightly older people want from the slightly younger people? They want credit for having survived so long, and often imaginatively, under difficult conditions... What is it the slightly younger people want from the slightly older people? More than anything, I think, they want acknowledgement, and without further ado, that they are without question women and men now.", work: "If This Isn't Nice, What is?"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Our president is a Christian? So was Adolf Hitler.", work: "I Love You, Madame Librarian"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Look, when you put a piece of paper in your typewriter, don’t you try to make it exactly what it should be?", work: "Requiem for a Dreamer"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "[Vietnam] only made billionaires out of millionaires. [Iraq] is making trillionaires out of billionaires. Now I call that progress.", work: "A Man Without a Country"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "My great-grandfather’s name was Clemens Vonnegut. Small world, small world. This piquant coincidence is not a fabrication. Clemens Vonnegut called himself a 'freethinker,' an antique word for humanist. He was a hardware merchant in Indianapolis.", work: "Strange Weather Lately"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "If I have offended some of you by speaking ill of Thomas Jefferson, tough titty for you.", work: "If This Isn’t Nice, What Is?"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I myself at one time tried to become a biochemist — as did our darling, terribly missed brother Isaac Asimov. He actually became one. I didn't have a chance. He was smarter than me. We both knew that, incidentally. He is in heaven now.", work: "Why My Dog Is Not a Humanist"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Conservatives are crazy as bedbugs.", work: "Strange Weather Lately"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Try this: The First World War was caused by the second one. Otherwise the first one makes no sense, wasn’t about anything. And all Picasso had to do was paint pictures that were already hanging in museums in the future.", work: "Requiem for a Dreamer"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "As in my other works of fiction: All persons living and dead are purely coincidental, and should not be construed. No names have been changed in order to protect the innocent. Angels protect the innocent as a matter of Heavenly routine.", work: "Bagombo Snuff Box"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "That’s one thing Earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: Ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones.", work: "Slaughterhouse-Five"),

    Quote(phrase: "The only advice my father ever gave me was this: 'Never stick anything in your ear.'", work: "If This Isn't Nice, What is?"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "'Religion is the opium of the people.' Marx said that back in 1844, when opium and opium derivatives were the only effective pain killers anyone could take. Marx himself had taken them. He was grateful for the temporary relief they had given him. He was simply noticing, and surely not condemning, the fact that religion could also be comforting to those in economic or social distress.", work: "If This Isn’t Nice, What Is"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "In the book, laws and order keep breaking down and when the law of gravity goes . . . well, you know how dependent New York city is on elevators.", work: "Two Conversations with Kurt..."),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Do you know what a Twerp is? When I was in high school in Indianapolis 65 years ago, a Twerp was a guy who stuck a set of false teeth up his rear end and bit the buttons off the backseats of taxicabs.", work: "Knowing What’s Nice"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "An artist says, ‘I can’t do anything about the chaos in the universe or my country, or even in my own miserable life, but I can at least make this piece of paper or canvas, or blob of clay or chunk of marble, exactly what it should be.’", work: "Requiem for a Dreamer"),

    Quote(phrase: "An awareness of the techniques — tricks, almost — of writing isn't original with me. You know the rules: if there is a shotgun hanging over the fireplace in the first chapter, somebody must fire it before the story is over or it has no business being there in the first place.", work: "Two Conversations with Kurt..."),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I suppose you will all want money and true love, among other things. I will tell you how to make money: work very hard.

    Quote(phrase: "I don't believe that we are about to be crucified.  No potential enemy we now face has anywhere near enough carpenters. Not even the Pentagon at budget time has mentioned crucifixion.", work: "Fates Worse than Death"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: " I leave it to an editor of taste and delicacy to abridge with innocent polka dots whatever might offend.", work: "Mother Night"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "We're in serious trouble. I once heard myself described as being embittered with humanity because of its wasteful acts. That notion distresses me. My real feeling is that human beings are too good for life. They've been put in the wrong place with the wrong things to do.", work: "Two Conversations with Kurt..."),
    
    Quote(phrase: "And I thank you for your attention and I'm out of here.", work: "Why My Dog Is Not a Humanist"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "I thought scientists were going to find out exactly how everything worked, and then make it work better. I fully expected that by the time I was twenty-one, some scientist would have taken a color photograph of God Almighty and sold it to Popular Mechanics magazine... What actually happened when I was twenty-one was that we dropped scientific truth on Hiroshima.", work: "Bennington College address"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "Salinger himself appeared to be on a quest, to find truths that were going to be of use to all of us. But he never found the Holy Grail — the quest was a fizzle.", work: "In-the-Bone Reading"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "If you don’t know what the Sermon on the Mount is, ask your kid’s computer.", work: "Article in Nation"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn — so he or she can see how it ends. Even Pitecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth — to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square — making change for peepshows. Or recruiting Marines.", work: "Happy Birthday, Wanda June"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "This place is full of the dumbest, sweetest mice. I haven’t the heart to harm them. … They keep me company and make me laugh.", work: "Kurt Vonnegut: Letters"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "If you think of laws arranged in that order in a deck of cards, God’s laws would be the aces, nature’s law would be the kings, and ACLU lawyers, attempting to secure the civil rights of the deuces and treys and even unpopular tens and jacks in our society, would have nothing but pipsqueak queens to play.", work: "If This Isn’t Nice, What Is?"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I’m simply interested in what is going to happen next. I don’t think I can control my life or my writing. Every other writer I know feels he is steering himself, and I don’t have that feeling. I don’t have that sort of control. I’m simply becoming. I’m startled that I became a writer.", work: "Article in The A to Z Review"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "She was a fool, and so am I, and so is anyone who thinks he sees what God is doing.", work: "Cat's Cradle"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "I have been a writer since 1949. I am self-taught. I have no theories about writing that might help others. When I write, I simply become what I seemingly must become. I am six feet two and weigh nearly two hundred pounds and am badly coordinated, except when I swim. All that borrowed meat does the writing. In the water, I am beautiful.", work: "Article in The A to Z Review"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "And I asked myself about the present: how wide it was, how deep it was, how much was mine to keep.", work: "Slaughterhouse-Five"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "You’re dismayed at having lost a year, maybe, because the school fell apart. Well — I feel as though I’ve lost the years since Slaughterhouse-Five was published, but that’s malarky. Those years weren’t lost. They simply weren’t the way I’d planned them. Neither was the year in which Jim had to stay motionless in bed while he got over TB. Neither was the year in which Mark went crazy, then put himself together again. Those years were adventures. Planned years are not.", work: "Kurt Vonnegut: Letters"),
    
    
    Quote(phrase: "Trout trudged onward, a stranger in a strange land. His pilgrimage was rewarded with new wisdom, which would never have been his had he remained in his basement in Cohoes. He learned the answer to a question many human beings were asking themselves so frantically: 'What's blocking the traffic on the westbound barrel of the Midland City stretch of the Interstate?'", work: "Breakfast of Champions"),
    
    Quote(phrase: "You learn about life by the accidents you have, over and over again.", work: "Interview in McSweeny's"),
